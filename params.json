Natural Language Query Interface is a Google Summer of Code, 2016 project under [vitrivr.org](https://vitrivr.org/).\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nIn this project, I have extended the [Cineast](https://github.com/dbisUnibas/cineast) user interface to support voice queries by converting speech query input to text and thus build a natural language query interface that gives full control to the user to interact with the user interface by speaking voice commands in a complete natural way. \r\n\r\n## Work Done\r\n\r\n* [Link to the commits made during GSoC period](https://github.com/prateek1985/vitrivr-ui/commits/master)\r\n\r\n* [Link to the list of functions added in the interface for natural interaction](https://github.com/prateek1985/vitrivr-ui#list-of-functions-which-voice-commands-can-do-in-interface)\r\n\r\n## Main features included in the interface\r\n\r\n* Natural interaction using follow-up voice commands\r\n\r\n* Spoken feedback by system for natural interaction\r\n\r\n* Perform certain actions by speaking the displayed number on video shots\r\n\r\n* Speech and mouse interaction\r\n\r\n* Flexible voice commands\r\n\r\n## Short Demo Video of my Work\r\n\r\nCineast is a content-based video retrieval engine which retrieves video sequences based on their visual content. This video shows natural interaction of a user with the UI of the system using natural language query interface\r\n\r\n## Other Links\r\n\r\n* [Project's github repository](https://github.com/prateek1985/vitrivr-ui)\r\n\r\n* [GSoC Project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5587149046939648)\r\n\r\n* [My profile](https://prateek1985.github.io/)\r\n",
